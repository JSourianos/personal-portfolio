                Through school I have learnt HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and my
                framework of choice is React.
                <br />I am also in the process of learning app development, and
                I have completed projects with both React Native for
                crossplatform and Kotlin for Native Android Development.

              <img src={design} />
              <h4>Design</h4>
              <p>
                I have also had courses in Responsive Design, and UX Interface
                design.
                <br />
                Figma and Adobe XD are the tools I am most familiar with, and I
                have created many projects with these tools.

              </h4>
              <p>
                I also have experience with agile methods such as Scrum, through
                our Agile Exam.
                <br />I also run a side-business outside of school where I
                design and create websites and webshops, both with Wordpress and
                with coding.
